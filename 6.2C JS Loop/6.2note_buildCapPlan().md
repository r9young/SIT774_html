function buildCapPlan() {
    const numWeeks = parseInt(document.getElementById('weekCountInput').value);
    const numCaps = parseInt(document.getElementById('capCountInput').value);

    if (numWeeks < 1 || numWeeks > 52) {
        alert(`Number of WEEKS must be between 1 and 52 (value ${numWeeks}).`);
        return;
    }

    if (numCaps < 1 || numCaps > 10) {
        alert(`Number of CAPS must be between 1 and 9 (value ${numCaps}).`);
        return;
    }

    const hatList = ["Baseball Cap", "Fedora", "Sun Hat", "Cowboy Hat", "Beret", "Trilby", "Top Hat", "Panama Hat", "Bowler Hat"];
    const selectedHatList = hatList.slice(0, numCaps);
 
    const capTable = [];

    for (let week = 0; week < numWeeks; week++) {
        const weekRow = [];
        for (let day = 0; day < 7; day++) {
            const hatIndex = (week * 7 + day) % selectedHatList.length;
            weekRow.push(selectedHatList[hatIndex]);
        }
        capTable.push(weekRow);
    }
    generateTable(capTable, numCaps); 
    // function composition or simply function calling another function.
}

### Read and process the user's input

**`const numWeeks = parseInt(document.getElementById('weekCountInput').value);`**

#### 1. Read Information 


- **`document.getElementById('weekCountInput').value`:** This retrieves the current value entered by the user in the `weekCountInput` field.

#### 2. Convert it into an integer

- **`parseInt(...)`:** Converts the string value from the input field into an integer, which is necessary because input values are typically returned as strings.

------

#### 1. Read Information 

```
const numWeeks = parseInt(document.getElementById('weekCountInput').value);
const numCaps = parseInt(document.getElementById('capCountInput').value);

```
```
 <input type="number" class="form-control" id="weekCountInput" min="1" max="52">
 <input type="number" class="form-control" id="capCountInput" min="1" max="10">

 ```

The HTML input fields and the JavaScript code work together to read and process the user's input. Here’s how it all fits together:

#### 2. Convert it into an integer:

You have two `<input>` elements defined in your HTML, each designed to capture a numeric value from the user:

```html
<input type="number" class="form-control" id="weekCountInput" min="1" max="52">
<input type="number" class="form-control" id="capCountInput" min="1" max="10">
```

- **`type="number"`:** Specifies that the input should accept numeric values.
  
- **`id="weekCountInput"` and `id="capCountInput"`:** These `id` attributes uniquely identify each input element so that you can easily reference them in your JavaScript code.
  
- **`min` and `max`:** These attributes set the minimum and maximum values the user is allowed to input:
  - `min="1"` and `max="52"` for the `weekCountInput` (to restrict weeks between 1 and 52).
  - `min="1"` and `max="10"` for the `capCountInput` (to restrict caps between 1 and 10).

### Extract a portion of the array

const hatList = ["Baseball Cap", "Fedora", "Sun Hat", "Cowboy Hat", "Beret", "Trilby", "Top Hat", "Panama Hat", "Bowler Hat"];
const selectedHatList = hatList.slice(0, numCaps);


The purpose of the line `const selectedHatList = hatList.slice(0, numCaps);` is to create a new array, `selectedHatList`, that contains only the first `numCaps` elements from the original `hatList` array. This allows your program to work with a subset of the hats based on the number of caps specified by the user.

#### Detailed Explanation:

1. **`hatList`:**
   - This is an array that contains all possible hats that could be included in the schedule. For example:
     ```javascript
     const hatList = ["Baseball Cap", "Fedora", "Sun Hat", "Cowboy Hat", "Beret", "Trilby", "Top Hat", "Panama Hat", "Bowler Hat"];
     ```

2. **`numCaps`:**
   - `numCaps` is a variable that holds the number of caps the user wants to include in the schedule. This value is determined based on the user’s input.

3. **`slice(0, numCaps)`:**
   - The `slice()` method is used to extract a portion of the array. 
   - `slice(0, numCaps)` means "start at index 0 (the first element) and continue up to, but not including, index `numCaps`."
   - If `numCaps` is 3, for example, `slice(0, 3)` would return the first three elements of the `hatList`.

4. **`selectedHatList`:**
   - The result of the `slice()` method is assigned to `selectedHatList`.
   - This new array contains only the first `numCaps` hats from `hatList`.

#### Example Scenario:

Suppose the `hatList` is:

```javascript
const hatList = ["Baseball Cap", "Fedora", "Sun Hat", "Cowboy Hat", "Beret", "Trilby", "Top Hat", "Panama Hat", "Bowler Hat"];
```

And let's say `numCaps = 3` based on user input.

The code:

```javascript
const selectedHatList = hatList.slice(0, numCaps);
```

Would result in:

```javascript
const selectedHatList = ["Baseball Cap", "Fedora", "Sun Hat"];
```

## Day


```html

for (let day = 0; day < 7; day++) {
    const hatIndex = (week * 7 + day) % selectedHatList.length;
    weekRow.push(selectedHatList[hatIndex]);
}

```

- **`const hatIndex = (week * 7) % selectedHatList.length;`** will determine the index of the cap that will be used for the entire week.
  
- By adding `day` to the calculation, as in **`const hatIndex = (week * 7 + day) % selectedHatList.length;`**, the index will change each day within the week, allowing the caps to cycle through the list daily.


### Without `day`:
- **`const hatIndex = (week * 7) % selectedHatList.length;`**
  - This calculation only depends on the week number and the total length of the `selectedHatList`.
  - As a result, it would select the same `hatIndex` for every day of a given week. 
  - For example, if `hatIndex` calculates to `2` for a particular week, the same cap (let’s say `"Cap3"`) would be used every day that week (Monday through Sunday).

### With `day`:
- **`const hatIndex = (week * 7 + day) % selectedHatList.length;`**
  - Adding `day` to the calculation means that the `hatIndex` now varies not just by week but also by day.
  - **Effectively, this makes the cap selection change each day** within the week, cycling through the caps in `selectedHatList` as the days progress.
  - For instance, on Monday of Week 0, it might select `"Cap1"`; on Tuesday, it might select `"Cap2"`, and so on, depending on how the modulo operation resolves.

### Summary:
- **Without `day`:** The `hatIndex` remains the same throughout all the days of a week, meaning the same cap is used for every day of that week.
- **With `day`:** The `hatIndex` changes for each day, ensuring a different cap is selected each day, providing variation and allowing the caps to be cycled through in a balanced way across the entire schedule.

So, by adding `day` to the formula, you're effectively ensuring that the cap selection "loops" or cycles through the list each day, rather than sticking with the same cap for the entire week. This gives you the desired effect of a varied and rotating cap schedule.
