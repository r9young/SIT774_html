# Understanding the Following Code


```javascript

function creatTable(weekCount, capCount) {
    const numWeeks = weekCount;
    const daysPerWeek = capCount;
    
    let tbody = document.getElementById("cap-planner-table-body");

    // Clear the previous content
    tbody.innerHTML = '';

    // Create rows for each week
    for (let week = 0; week < numWeeks; week++) {
        const tr = document.createElement('tr');
        const weekCell = document.createElement('td');
        weekCell.textContent = `Week ${week + 1}`;
        tr.appendChild(weekCell);

        // Fill days with caps
        for (let day = 0; day < daysPerWeek; day++) {
            const td = document.createElement('td');
            tr.appendChild(td);
        }
        tbody.appendChild(tr);
    }
}

Your understanding is almost correct, but let's clarify it slightly:

### Explanation:

1. **Creating the First Row:**
   ```javascript
   for (let week = 0; week < numWeeks; week++) {
       const tr = document.createElement('tr'); // Creates a new row element.
       const weekCell = document.createElement('td'); // Creates a cell for the week number.
       weekCell.textContent = `Week ${week + 1}`; // Sets the text content of the cell to "Week 1", "Week 2", etc.
       tr.appendChild(weekCell); // Appends the week number cell to the row.
   ```

   - This part of the code creates a new row (`<tr>`) for each week and adds a single cell (`<td>`) to the row that displays the week number (e.g., "Week 1", "Week 2"). However, this is not just for the first row; it happens for each week within the loop.

2. **Creating Columns (Cells) in Each Row:**
   ```javascript
   // Fill days with caps
   for (let day = 0; day < daysPerWeek; day++) {
       const td = document.createElement('td'); // Creates a new cell for each day.
       tr.appendChild(td); // Appends each day cell to the current row.
   }
   tbody.appendChild(tr); // Appends the entire row (with week number and day cells) to the table body.
   ```

   - This second part of the code runs after the week number cell is added. It adds additional cells to the same row (`tr`) for each day in the week, based on the value of `daysPerWeek` (which you referred to as caps). These cells are empty in the provided code, but they represent the days within that week.

### Summary:

- **Row Creation**: The loop beginning with `for (let week = 0; week < numWeeks; week++)` creates a new row for each week.
- **Week Number Cell**: The first cell in each row is created and filled with the week number.
- **Day Cells (Columns)**: The inner loop adds additional cells to the same row, representing each day of the week.

So, the code doesn't just create the first row—it creates multiple rows, each corresponding to a week, and within each row, it creates multiple columns (cells) for the days.



### Why the Columns Don’t Overlap?

When the row (<tr>) is created, it starts off empty.
